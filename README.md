## Highlights

* Human-level, state-of-the-art performance on retinal artery/vein segmentation and classification.
    + Evaluated on three public datasets: RITE, LES-AV, and HRF.
* Novel recursive framework for solving manifest errors in semantic segmentation maps.
    + First framework to combine module stacking and recursive refinement approaches.
* Stand-alone recursive refinement module for post-processing artery/vein segmentation maps.



## Overview

## Previous work

This approach builds on our previous work presented in the paper ["Simultaneous segmentation and classification of the retinal arteries and veins from color fundus images"](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.artmed.2021.102116), published in _Artificial Intelligence in Medicine_ (2021).


## Basic usage

The models can be easily used with the `model.py` code and loading the weights with Hugging Face ðŸ¤—. The only requirement is to have the `torch`, `huggingface_hub`, and `safetensors` packages installed.

```python
from huggingface_hub import PyTorchModelHubMixin
from model import RRWNet as RRWNetModel


class RRWNet(RRWNetModel, PyTorchModelHubMixin):
    def __init__(self, input_ch=3, output_ch=3, base_ch=64, iterations=5):
        super().__init__(input_ch, output_ch, base_ch, iterations)


model = RRWNet.from_pretrained("j-morano/rrwnet-rite")
# or rrwnet-hrf for the HRF dataset
```


## Predictions and weights

The predictions for the different datasets as well as the weights for the proposed RRWNet model can be found at the following links:

- GitHub (release assets):
  + Weights: <https://github.com/j-morano/rrwnet/releases/tag/weights>
  + Predictions: <https://github.com/j-morano/rrwnet/releases/download/preds-n-data/Predictions.zip>


The model trained on the RITE dataset was trained using the original image resolution, while the model trained on HRF was trained using images resized to a width of 1024 pixels. The weights for the RITE dataset are named `rrwnet_RITE_1.pth`, while the weights for the HRF dataset are named `rrwnet_HRF_0.pth`.
Please note that the size of the images used for training is important when using the weights for predictions.


## Data format

Our code always expects the images to be RGB images with pixel values in the range [0, 255] and the masks to be RGB images with the following segmentation maps in each channel:

* Red channel: Arteries
* Green channel: Veins
* Blue channel: Vessels (union of arteries and veins)

The masks should be binary images with pixel values in the range [0, 255].
The predictions will be saved in the same format as the masks.


## Setting up the environment


The code was tested using Python 3.10.10.
However, it should work with other Python versions and package managers.
Just make sure to install the required packages listed in `requirements.txt`.
If you want to use this exact Python version, it can be easily installed using `pyenv` as shown in the next section.
Otherwise, you can skip to the [Requirements](#requirements) section.


### Python 3.10.10 (`pyenv`)

> [!IMPORTANT]
> The following steps are only necessary if you want to install Python 3.10.10 using `pyenv`.

Install `pyenv`.
```sh
curl https://pyenv.run | bash
```

Install `clang`. _E.g._:
```sh
sudo dnf install clang
```

Install Python version 3.10.10.
```sh
CC=clang pyenv install -v 3.10.10
```

Create and activate Python environment.
```sh
~/.pyenv/versions/3.10.10/bin/python3 -m venv venv/
source venv/bin/activate  # bash
. venv/bin/activate.fish  # fish
```

Update `pip`.

```sh
pip install --upgrade pip
```


### Requirements

Create and activate Python environment.
```sh
python -m venv venv/
source venv/bin/activate  # bash
. venv/bin/activate.fish  # fish
```

Install requirements using `requirements.txt`.

```sh
pip3 install -r requirements.txt
```


## Preprocessing (optional)

You can preprocess the images offline using the `preprocessing.py` script. The script will enhance the images and masks and save them in the specified directory.

```bash
python3 preprocessing.py --images-path data/images/ --masks-path data/masks/ --save-path data/enhanced
```


## Get predictions

To get predictions using the provided weights, run the `get_predictions.py` script. The script will save the predictions in the specified directory.
If the images were not previously preprocessed, you can use the `--preprocess` flag to preprocess the images on the fly.

```bash
python3 get_predictions.py --weights rrwnet_RITE_1.pth --images-path data/images/ --masks-path data/masks/ --save-path predictions/ --preprocess
```


## Refine existing predictions

You can refine existing predictions (e.g., from a different model) using the same `get_predictions.py` script. The script will save the refined predictions in the specified directory.
Just make sure to provide the path to the predictions and the weights to be used for the refinement.
Also, do not forget to use the `--refine` flag and do not use the `--preprocess` flag.

```bash
python3 get_predictions.py --weights rrwnet_RITE_refinement.pth --images-path data/U-Net_predictions/ --masks-path data/masks/ --save-path refined_predictions/ --refine
```


## Training

All training code can be found in the `train/` directory. The training script is `train.py`, and the configuration file, with all the hyperparameters and command line arguments, is `config.py`.
Please follow the instructions in [train/README.md](train/README.md) to train the model.
The `train/` directory also contains the code to get the predictions of the model on the test set, which are then used for the evaluation.


## Evaluation

All evaluation code can be found in the `eval/` directory.
Please follow the instructions in [eval/README.md](eval/README.md).



## Contact
